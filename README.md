# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
A stroke is a medical condition caused by poor blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death and
the impairment of brain function. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of
blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. The symptoms of a stroke may include an
inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness,
or loss of vision to one side. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure, but other risk
factors include high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and previous TIAs or heart
conditions. Prevention includes reducing risk factors and taking medication such as aspirin or
statins. Emergency care is required for stroke or TIA, and treatment to attempt recovery of lost
function is called stroke rehabilitation.
